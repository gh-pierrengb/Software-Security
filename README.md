# Software-Security
### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial needed secure communication software to protect sensitive data and comply with international regulations, addressing cybersecurity threats and legal compliance issues.
### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I excelled in identifying vulnerabilities through a detailed manual review and static testing, crucial for preventing data breaches and ensuring compliance.
### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The static testing of third-party libraries was challenging but insightful for identifying critical vulnerabilities.
### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security by updating vulnerable dependencies, enhancing input validation, and improving database access security, planning to use automated tools and manual reviews for future assessments.
### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured functionality and security by rigorous testing and using tools like Maven Dependency-Check post-refactoring to avoid new vulnerabilities.
### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I relied on secure coding practices, regular dependency checks, and comprehensive testing strategies, valuable for future projects.
### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would showcase the detailed vulnerability assessment, mitigation strategies, and the successful update of dependencies to demonstrate my ability to enhance software security effectively.
